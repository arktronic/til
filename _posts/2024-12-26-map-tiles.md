Some interesting links related to OpenStreetMap and raster/vector tiles:

[osm2pgsql](https://github.com/osm2pgsql-dev/osm2pgsql) loads OSM data into Postgres + PostGIS. This, however, is no longer strictly necessary, due to newer vector generators that are able to ingest OSM PBF files directly.

[Shortbread Vector Tiles](https://github.com/shortbread-tiles/shortbread-docs) is a lightweight vector tile spec. Used in conjunction with [Planetiler](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler), with Shortbread-specific configuration, you can output an MBTiles or PMTiles file. MBTiles files require a tile server such as [Martin](https://github.com/maplibre/martin), while PMTiles files can be served directly, as long as the host supports HTTP Range requests. [VersaTiles](https://github.com/versatiles-org/versatiles-style) can then be used for styling the vector tiles, displayed in MapLibre GL or a compatible system.
